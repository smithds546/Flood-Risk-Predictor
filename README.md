# Flood-Risk-Predictor
In an AI Methods module in university we used our lectures on Artificial Nueral Networks to create an AI model which trains itself on some data and can predict whether a location is a high risk for flooding.

We were supplied the entire data set and had to appropriately split the data into Training (60%) , Testing (20&) and validation sets (20%). We had to maniuplate certain variables in order to reach a minimal error rate in as little epochs to ensure maximum efficiency.

In this module i learnt the value of trial and error and trying many different combinatiosn to try and achiev the optimal result. There were a selection of improvements which could be applied to the Nueral Network and i enjoyed the trial and error process of tryng to find the optimla setup of the nueral network.
